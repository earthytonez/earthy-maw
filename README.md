ToDo:
1. Generative Drone Synth
    ~~A. Create a MobX Store and all data structures within that store.~~
    ~~B. Make it so that the Track and Sequencer Use the Key and Scale~~
    C. Create a side panel that makes a thing editable.
    D. Make it so that the Key and Scale are modulatable by hour of the day.
    E. Evolve the Drones to be modulatable and more musical/editable.

2. Generative House Synth
3. More House Patterns
4. Recreate a song (Fargone Suite?)
5. Add retro color hash to devices.   Circle for Arranger, Square for Sequencer, Triangle for Instrument.
